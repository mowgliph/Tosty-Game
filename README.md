# Tosty Game

The project I did in Scratch is a mini-game. It starts with an instruction screen where you have to use the space bar on the keyboard to start the game. 

The development of the game is based on collecting as many points as you can by touching the Tostys that are falling in just 20 seconds, you must be very fast to do it. You must also be careful with the bombs in the game that explode when you touch them and subtract points.

To collect these points you use the mouse click that when you click it shows you for a brief moment the points acquired. At the end of the time you will see a winner screen with the amount of points obtained, and gives you the opportunity to play again if you want by touching the space bar on the keyboard. In case you do not score points and just let run there is another screen that will tell you to try again in the same way by touching the space bar on the keyboard.
